## 2026-09-14 — repo created. Carried-over state from penny-box, and what rung 2 has to answer.

`~/Documents/penny-app-spike` initialised as a new git repo next to
`~/Documents/penny-box`. penny-box is closed at commit d5a8371.

**Why a second repo.** penny-box asked whether the hardware and the OS
can run a Linux VM at all. It can, and that is settled. This repo asks a
different kind of question: not "does the machinery work" but "who is
allowed to drive it". The answer to that is a permission question, not a
capability question, and it decides whether Penny can ship as an app or
has to ship as an operating system.

**What carried over, verified on this device, from penny-box rung 1:**

- `adb shell /apex/com.android.virt/bin/vm run-microdroid` boots a VM as
  the unprivileged `shell` user on locked GrapheneOS with verified boot.
  No `pm grant` was needed and none was attempted.
- `vm list` showed that VM at `requesterUid: 2000` (Android's shell user)
  alongside the Terminal app's Debian VM at `requesterUid: 10179`. Two
  distinct owners, enumerated together in one call.
- Both VMs ran side by side. Boot to payload-ready was 1.14 seconds.
- The Debian guest did not notice the second VM. Across the launch minute
  its uptime advanced 60.15s against a 60s wall clock, used memory FELL
  3M, load went 0.08 to 0.12 and back. 55 samples, no gaps, 54 minutes.
- The expected memory-pressure kill on a 6GB phone did not happen at all.

Conclusion carried forward: **VM ownership is not the Terminal app's
private property.** The machinery is reachable from outside it.

**What rung 1 did not prove, and why rung 2 exists.** The payload that
booted was `EmptyPayloadApp`, which ships inside the `com.android.virt`
APEX and is platform-signed. Running it exercises
`MANAGE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE`, whose protection level carries `preinstalled`
— an escape hatch our app cannot use.
`USE_CUSTOM_VIRTUAL_MACHINE`, which has no such escape and which our own
guest image requires, has never been touched on this device.

**Not an attestation result.** The microdroid run logged `Using sample
DICE values` because it was a debuggable VM. No attestation claim rests
on anything proven so far.

**Device state at the time of writing** (unchanged from penny-box):
Pixel 6a (bluejay), 6GB Micron DRAM, 128GB Micron UFS. GrapheneOS
2026091001, Android 17, build ID CP2A.260705.006, patch 2026-09-01.
Bootloader `bluejay-17.0-15199431`, LOCKED, `verifiedbootstate=yellow`,
OEM unlocking deliberately left ENABLED. Debian 13.6 trixie in the guest,
kernel 6.12.92-android16-6-...-4k. Claude Code 2.1.270 installed and
authenticated in the guest, ~317MiB resident. VM slider at max: 3.9GB,
reporting 3.6Gi inside. 8 cores, 104G disk.

The q9 endurance sampler is dead — the device was rebooted. Its log
survives at `/home/droid/q9-soak.log` inside the Debian guest, 55 samples
ending 10:29:20Z.

**The API question, settled before this repo existed, recorded here so it
is not researched a third time.** `android.system.virtualmachine` is
`@SystemApi` and is not in the public SDK. In
`packages/modules/Virtualization/libs/framework-virtualization/api/`,
`current.txt` — the public surface — is empty, one line reading
`// Signature format: 2.0`, and all seven classes sit in
`system-current.txt`. `VirtualMachineManager` is annotated `@SystemApi`
at class level and on every public method. The module README states the
APIs "require the restricted android.permission.MANAGE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE
permission, so they are not available to third party apps" — and, in the
same breath, that "it can also be granted to other apps via `adb shell pm
grant` for development purposes". That second sentence is what keeps rung
2 alive.

Protection levels, read off this device in penny-box:

    MANAGE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE      signature|development|preinstalled
    USE_CUSTOM_VIRTUAL_MACHINE  signature|development
    DEBUG_VIRTUAL_MACHINE       signature

`development` is the operative word: both of the first two can be granted
over adb for prototyping, without building an OS.

For contrast, the Terminal app — the uid 10179 VM owner — is built
`platform_apis: true`, `privileged: true`, inside the `com.android.virt`
APEX. A privileged, platform-signed system app. Our app will be none of
those things.

**Consequence for tooling.** An app using these APIs cannot be compiled
in Android Studio against the stock `android.jar`, because the classes
are absent from it. Two routes exist that do not need a full AOSP
checkout: swap in an AOSP-built `android.jar` that carries the system
surface, or use reflection against the stock SDK. That is Matt's choice
and has not been made.

**No CLI fallback.** AOSP's `docs/custom_vm.md` describes the `vm run`
custom-VM route as requiring root over adb. There is no root on a locked
build. If the app route fails, there is no second route on this device.

**Rung 2 is three results, not one.** 2a: can a sideloaded app touch the
API at all — object, `SecurityException`, or `NoClassDefFoundError`.
Whether Android's runtime non-SDK restrictions permit a sideloaded,
non-platform-signed APK to reach `@SystemApi` members after `pm grant` is
genuinely unknown; the expectation is that the permission check is the
real gate, but no source states it plainly and at least one cautions that
the restrictions still apply to non-system apps. 2b: does it own a VM
running Google's stock microdroid payload — proven by a `requesterUid` in
`vm list` that is neither 2000 nor 10179. 2c: does it own a VM running
our own guest image, with `USE_CUSTOM_VIRTUAL_MACHINE` granted.
`USE_CUSTOM_VIRTUAL_MACHINE` carries no `@RequiresPermission` annotation
anywhere in the API surface; VirtualizationService checks it at
VM-creation time when the config is a custom one — so 2b and 2c differ by
which config object is built, not by which method is called. The gap
between 2b and 2c is the entire product question.

Nothing has been installed, built or run for this repo yet. No device
action has been taken.

## 2026-09-14 — rung 2 pre-flight: the Mac's build toolchain. Nothing is installed. Three things are missing.

Checked before writing any app code, on the Mac
(`mattstevenson@Matts-MacBook-Pro-2`). Three commands, no installs.

**JDK: ABSENT.**

    /usr/libexec/java_home -V
    The operation couldn't be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.

`java_home` is macOS's own JDK registry. It reports no JVM of any version,
which means no Oracle JDK, no Temurin, no Homebrew `openjdk`, and no
Android Studio bundled JBR — Studio registers its own runtime here when
present.

**Android Studio: ABSENT. Android SDK: ABSENT.**

    ls -d /Applications/Android*.app ~/Library/Android/sdk

returned nothing. `~/Library/Android/sdk` is the default SDK root on
macOS and does not exist, so there are no build-tools, no platform jars
and no `sdkmanager`.

**What does exist: Homebrew's platform-tools, and only that.**

    which adb
    /opt/homebrew/bin/adb

That is the `android-platform-tools` Homebrew cask — `adb` and `fastboot`
as standalone binaries. It is the whole reason every penny-box device
command worked. It contains no compiler, no SDK platform, no
`aapt2`/`d8`, and no `android.jar` of any kind. It can install and talk to
an APK; it cannot build one.

**Therefore, to build any APK at all, three things are missing, in this
dependency order:** a JDK; an Android SDK (a platform jar to compile
against, build-tools to package and sign with); and a build driver
(Gradle, or Android Studio which bundles both Gradle and a JDK).

This is a genuinely clean machine as far as Android development goes —
which is the right starting point for this spike, because whatever we
install is a deliberate choice rather than something inherited.

Not yet decided, and deliberately not decided here: whether to install
full Android Studio or command-line tooling only, and whether the app
compiles against an AOSP-built `android.jar` or reaches the `@SystemApi`
surface by reflection against the stock SDK. Both are Matt's calls.

## 2026-09-14 — rung 2 route DECIDED: reflection to probe, stubs to build on. The third-party jar rejected.

Matt's call, taken after the trade-off was put to him in plain English.
**Reflection for 2a. Self-written stub classes for 2b and 2c.**

**The reasoning that decided it, and it is worth not losing.** All three
candidate routes — reflection, stub classes, third-party AOSP
`android.jar` — differ only in how the *compiler* is satisfied. The
compiler refuses to name a class that is absent from the public
`android.jar`, and each route is a different way around that refusal.
None of them changes what happens on the phone. Android enforces the real
gate at call time: does this app hold `MANAGE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE`, and is it
permitted to touch this member? That enforcement is identical in all
three cases.

The consequence is the useful part: **a 2a verdict reached by reflection
binds on every route.** A yes is a real yes for stubs and for the AOSP
jar. A no is a real no for both. Only the shape of the error text
differs — a reflection failure surfaces as `ClassNotFoundException` /
`NoSuchMethodException`, a direct-linkage failure as
`NoClassDefFoundError` / `NoSuchMethodError`. Same gate, different
messenger. This is why we can afford to answer the unknown cheaply
without committing to tooling first.

So: 2a is ~20 lines of reflection — ask Android for the class by its name
as a string, try to obtain a `VirtualMachineManager`, report which of the
three outcomes came back. No extra downloads beyond the standard Google
SDK. Then, once the API is known to be reachable, switch to stubs for 2b
and 2c, where VM config objects get built through long builder chains and
reflection stops being merely ugly and starts being a source of its own
bugs.

**Stub classes, for the record, since they are what we will actually
build on.** We write our own minimal versions of the seven classes —
correct package, correct names, correct method signatures, empty bodies —
and mark them compile-only so they are never packaged into the APK. The
compiler is satisfied; at runtime the phone supplies the real
implementations. This is the established technique for reaching a hidden
Android API from a normal app (Shizuku is built this way). Its one real
hazard is recorded now so it is not mistaken for a result later: **if our
stub signatures do not exactly match the real ones, the app crashes on
the phone in a way that can read as the permission being refused when it
is not.** That is precisely the signal 2a exists to read, which is a
second reason to get 2a's verdict by reflection first, while no stub
exists to muddy it.

**Third-party AOSP-built `android.jar`: REJECTED.** It would be the least
work — the full internal API surface, compiled, published on GitHub by
third parties. Rejected on trust and on maintenance. Google does not
distribute these, so adopting one means an unofficial binary of unknown
provenance sitting in the build of a project whose entire premise is a
locked, verified, attested device; and it would have to be re-sourced for
every Android version. Recorded as considered and declined rather than
overlooked.

Still undecided: full Android Studio versus command-line tooling only.

## 2026-09-14 — scope correction: `pm grant` cannot ship. What rung 2 actually buys.

Raised by Matt while the route decision was being committed — that this
is a commercial product and the way we develop has to reflect that.
Correct, and it sharpens what these rungs are for. Recorded here and in
CLAUDE.md in the same step.

**`pm grant` is not a distribution mechanism.** Both permissions rung 2
depends on are `development` protection level:

    MANAGE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE      signature|development|preinstalled
    USE_CUSTOM_VIRTUAL_MACHINE  signature|development

`development` means grantable over adb, by a person holding a cable, on a
device in front of them. There is no path to granting them on a
customer's device — no runtime prompt, no Play Store flow, nothing. A
sideloaded app that owns a VM is therefore **not a product**, and rung 2
succeeding does not produce one.

**What it does produce** is the only thing that matters at this stage: a
demonstration that VirtualizationService will take orders from an
ordinary app process rather than only from platform-signed system
components. That is a question about Android's architecture, not about
our packaging, and it is answerable cheaply. If the answer is no — if the
runtime refuses a non-platform-signed APK even with the permission
granted — then rung 4 is pointless and the whole phone-based approach
needs re-examining before weeks are spent on an OS build. **Rung 2 is a
go/no-go gate on rung 4, not a shipping milestone.**

**The commercial route is rung 4 and only rung 4:** the app built into
the GrapheneOS image, signed with our platform key, holding the
permissions because it is part of the system, with attestation covering
it. At that point the app is compiled inside AOSP against the genuine
system API surface — and reflection and stubs both become unnecessary and
get deleted. Neither technique is intended to survive contact with a
shipping build.

So the development pattern, stated once so it does not have to be
rediscovered: **prove it cheaply outside the OS, then build it properly
inside the OS.** The failure mode to guard against is a working `pm
grant` prototype being mistaken for a product, and rung 4 being deferred
on the strength of it.

## 2026-09-14 — toolchain installed on the Mac. Command-line only, no IDE. One trap found on the way out.

Matt's call: **command-line tooling only, no Android Studio.** Reasoning
recorded because it will be questioned later. Every build becomes a
command that can be pasted, which is how this project already works and
means the exact invocation lands in `notes.md` and is reproducible.
Studio is a code editor, and Matt does not write code — Claude writes the
files, Matt runs the commands — so most of its ~2GB is weight we never
touch. `adb logcat` already covers reading errors off the phone. And rung
4 ultimately happens on a headless Linux build machine with no IDE at
all, so the command-line habit is the one worth building.

**Installed, in dependency order, all via Homebrew (already present — it
is where penny-box's `adb` came from):**

    Temurin JDK        21.0.12.1 (arm64, Eclipse Adoptium)
                       /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk
    cmdline-tools      brew cask android-commandlinetools, 156.1MB
                       SDK root /opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools
    platforms;android-37.0      rev 2
    build-tools;37.0.0          37.0.0
    platform-tools              37.0.1
    Gradle             9.7.1 (build time 2026-08-19)

`/usr/libexec/java_home -V` went from "Unable to locate a Java Runtime"
to reporting Temurin 21, which is the check that the JDK registered
properly rather than merely unpacking somewhere.

**Which Android platform, and why it was looked up rather than guessed.**
The device runs Android 17. `sdkmanager --list` shows Android 17 as API
**37**, with stable `platforms;android-37.0` plus quarterly minor
releases `37.1` and `37.2`, beta builds, and a `CANARY` channel. We
compile against `android-37.0` — the stable release matching the device —
with `build-tools;37.0.0` to match. Nothing about the reflection probe
needs a specific platform, but matching the device removes a variable
from a test whose entire output is an error message.

**TRAP, found immediately and not yet worked around:** `brew install
gradle` pulls Homebrew's own `openjdk` as a dependency, and Gradle runs
on it in preference to Temurin. `gradle --version` reports:

    Launcher JVM:  26.0.2.1 (Homebrew 26.0.2.1)
    Daemon JVM:    /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/26.0.2.1/... (no Daemon JVM specified)

That is **JDK 26**, not the Temurin 21 we installed. The Android Gradle
Plugin does not support a JDK that new, and the resulting failure would
arrive as a compile or plugin error — i.e. it would read as our code or
our permissions being wrong when the real cause is the Java version. Note
also that `/usr/libexec/java_home` does **not** list this JDK 26, because
Homebrew formula JDKs are not registered with macOS's JVM registry; so
the earlier "only Temurin 21 is installed" check was true and still
misleading about what Gradle would actually pick up.

Fix, to be applied when the project is created: pin the build explicitly
with `org.gradle.java.home` in the project's `gradle.properties`, rather
than relying on a `JAVA_HOME` environment variable that lives only in one
terminal session. Pinned in the repo, it survives new shells, reboots and
a different machine.

Nothing has been built and no device action has been taken.
